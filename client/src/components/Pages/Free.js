            <span>Hardcore Self Help:</span>F**k Anxiety: Volume 1 - I love
            any anxiety resource that isn't boring and over medical, that's why
            I created this blog in the first place, so an anxiety book with
            swearing and humour that still gets the job done? hell fucking yes.

            <span>We're All Mad Here:</span>The No-Nonsense Guide to Living

            mention her book too! It-s always refreshing to read something about
            Social Anxiety from someone who actually does have it themselves but
            even more refreshing when it's personable and down to earth.
